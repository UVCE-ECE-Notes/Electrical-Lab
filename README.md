For Viva Qns focus more on 1.pdf as it has better questions compared to the 2nd PDF

1. Just by heart each and every thing about impedance triangle (units, triangle, definition everything). It's crazy important. (Refer handwritten AC circuit notes for impedance triangle)

2. Remember SPST full form. (VV Imp)

3. In wattmeter even by mistake *DON'T* draw more than 2 loops,  for the ML coil.

4. Be prepared to answer this Qn, 
   What happens to power factor when u add capacitor to tube light, and what causes this change in power factor ?

Most important thing, never mess with EEE faculty. In externals incase u don't know something. Don't even try to copy from person next to you or show ur answers to anyone. 

### **THESE ARE JUST FEW V.IMP Quest NEVER STICK TO ONLY THESE QUESTIONS STUDY EVERYTHING!!!!**
